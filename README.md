# My capstone case studies for the Google Data Analytics Certificate

To complete this certificate, I had to design and implement a case study that focuses on the process of data analysis, as was taught in the course. This included the following phases. I had three options for the case study: X, Y and Z. So, in the interest of gaining more practice with my data analytics tools, I decided to do all three. Thus in this repositiory, you will find the following three case studies, with explanations of the process:

1. [Case study 1](#case1)
2. [Case study 2](#case2)
3. [Case study 3](#case3)
