# My capstone case studies for the Google Data Analytics Certificate

During some free time at university, I enrolled in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&utm_content=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&campaignid=12566515400&adgroupid=117869292845&device=c&keyword=google%20data%20certification&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=507290840621&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwieuGBhAsEiwA1Ly_nW0b8kYk9covlwaMOn7AAHj-pwimBJu1BJoDXrcxvuykE_Vm3paHGRoCdfYQAvD_BwE) to sharpen my skills with data analytics tools that I want to use. In the process, I was greeted by a collection of instructors that each handed me the start of a thread that lead deeper into the tapestry of analytics. This is due to the course having a strong focus on the methodology of data analytics projects, with each phase representing an area of expertise to explore. The phases that Google suggests are:

* Ask, or a preliminary analysis of the scenario
* Prepare, or XXX
* Process, or cleaning and preparing the data for analysis
* Analyse, or finding patterns and generating insights using the data
* Share, or creating visualisations and presentations
* Act, or taking action with stakeholders given the new insights

To complete the certificate, I had to design and complete a case study that implements this methodology, as was taught in the course. I had three options for the case study, but, in the interest of gaining more practice with my data analytics tools, I decided that all three are good applications to explore. Thus in this repositiory, you will find the following three case studies that I have completed using the methodology above:

1. [Developing a new marketing strategy to increase influx of annual memberships at a bike-sharing company](#case1)
2. [Guide a marketing strategy based on how users interact with fitness smart devices](#case2)
3. [Case study 3](#case3)

The first two are theoretical case studies created by Google, and thus all the data was provided by them. For the last option, however, I had to find an alternative data source. Here follows my three case studies. As stated above, these case studies will implement the Google Data Analytics methodology.

### Step 1 - Initial scenario investigation

### Step 2 - Obtaining the correct data

### Step 3 - Cleaning and processing the data

### Step 4 - Analysis

### Step 5 - Visualisation and presentation

### Step 6 - Call to action
