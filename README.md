# My capstone case studies for the Google Data Analytics Certificate

During some free time at university, I enrolled in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&utm_content=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&campaignid=12566515400&adgroupid=117869292845&device=c&keyword=google%20data%20certification&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=507290840621&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwieuGBhAsEiwA1Ly_nW0b8kYk9covlwaMOn7AAHj-pwimBJu1BJoDXrcxvuykE_Vm3paHGRoCdfYQAvD_BwE)To complete this certificate, I had to design and implement a case study that focuses on the process of data analysis, as was taught in the course. This included the following phases. I had three options for the case study: X, Y and Z. So, in the interest of gaining more practice with my data analytics tools, I decided to do all three. Thus in this repositiory, you will find the following three case studies, with explanations of the process:

1. [Developing a new marketing strategy to increase influx of annual memberships](#case1)
2. [Case study 2](#case2)
3. [Case study 3](#case3)
